Steps 1 and 2 need to only be performed once per genome of interest. The output files will be used for steps 3 and 4.
Steps 3 and 4 are dependent on your data. The input files required are .fastq sequencing files or .sam files that are premapped to your genome of interest. The output file required for FiTnEss is a tally file that sums the reads at each TA insertion site.


Step 1. TA site pre-processing. This step uses your .fasta genome file of interest and identifies: TA sites, non-permissive TA sites (sites that do not allow transposon insertions), and homologous TA sites (sites that occur >1 in your genome that reads cannot be accurately mapped to). Software required: Python

a. genome_info folder requires: your_genome.fasta, your_genome_reverse_complement.fasta (this can be generated with any free online reverse complement software such as http://reverse-complement.com).
b. Modify execute_TAsite_preprocessing.sh to reflect your_genome name.
c. These scripts need not be modified, but are required in the scripts folder: 50bp_TA_sequence_extractor.py, homology_finder.py, nonpermissive_TAFinder.py, TAFinder.py
d. Output files in the TAsite_info folder: TA_sites.txt, nonpermissive_TA_sites.txt, homologous_TA_sites.txt
e. Run command in terminal by navigating to this root folder containing the execute_TAsite_preprocessing.sh file. Type:
sh execute_TAsite_preprocessing.sh


Step 2. Generating a genelist. This step requires a .gff3 file or similar that contains a gene identifier and the respective gene start/stop coordinates to your_genome.fasta file. Software required: Excel, text editor, R, or similar.

a. Obtain .gff file or similar for your_genome.fasta
b. Create genelist file: your_genelist.txt in tab-delimited text format, where each row is a gene. Column 1 is the chromosome #, column 2 is Gene_ID, columns 3-5 are blank, column 6 is the chromosomal gene start, column 7 is the chromosomal gene stop

Example top 2 rows for P. aeruginosa strain PA14:
1	PA14_00010				483	2027
1	PA14_00020				2056	3159


Step 3. Mapping .fastq sequencing files to genome. This step converts your .fastq files into .sam files using your_genome.fasta. Software required: Bowtie. If you have access to computer servers, this step will be much faster than running on a local computer.

a. If running locally, place your_sample.fastq and your_genome.fasta in sample_data folder
b. After installing Bowtie, navigate to this root folder and build genome by typing:
bowtie-build ./genome_info/your_genome.fasta ./genome_info/your_genome
c. Step 3b needs to be performed only once per your_genome.fasta file.
d. Map your_sample.fastq file to your_genome using Bowtie by typing:
bowtie -v 0 -q -m 1 -S ./genome_info/your_genome ./sample_data/your_sample.fastq ./sample_data/your_sample.sam
d. -v 0 indicates that exact mapping will be performed, -m 1 indicates that reads will only be mapped to a site if that site is the only possibility
e. Output file is your_sample.sam file in the sample_data folder


Step 4. Tallying reads per TA site from .sam file
Software required: Python

a. Scripts required in scripts folder: tally.py (modified to your genome as indicated in the file)
b. Files required in TAsite_info folder: TA_sites.txt (generated in Step 1 for your genome)
c. Files required in genome_info folder: your_genelist.txt (generated in Step 2 for your genome)
d. Files required in the sample_data folder: your_sample.sam file (generated in step 3)

Example command:
python ./scripts/tally.py ./TAsite_info/TA_sites.txt ./sample_data/your_sample.sam ./genome_info/your_genelist.txt > ./sample_data/your_sample_tally.txt


Steps 3&4. These steps can be run sequentially by typing:
sh execute_mapping_tallying.sh
